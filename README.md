MERN Challenge

## Description

In Module 21, we were tasked with refactoring a Book Search Engine. This application has been developed using the MERN stack, incorporating a React front end, MongoDB database, Node.js, Express.js, and API. It was initially configured to enable users to save book searches on the back end.
